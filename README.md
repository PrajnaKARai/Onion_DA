ðŸŒ± A Shiny Web Application for Agricultural Decision-Making

Developed as part of the XXXXX Project (hyperlink).

ðŸ’¡ Purpose
This application helps compare onion yields under different climate scenarios, incorporating user-defined risk estimates.

Users can:

Define probability distributions for key input parameters through dynamic UI elements.

Integrate government or private funding schemes.

Run Monte Carlo simulations to explore outcomes under uncertainty.

Visualize results with interactive plots (e.g., yield comparisons, scenario analyses, funding impacts).

âœ¨ Acknowledgements
This tool was developed with the support of XXXXXX and the INRES Horticultural Sciences, University of Bonn. 
We gratefully acknowledge the contributions of agricultural experts, including onion producers, advisors, policy-makers, researchers and users of tool.
